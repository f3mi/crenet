Activity Title: PHP and Databases

Activity Details; I'm currently on database 6hours learning on PHP PDO Basics
  Today, i took tutorials from lynda on how to connect to a database usin PHP data object PDO.
The content of the tutorials from lynda on PDO are as follow
PDO connection to the database created
Looping directly over a select query in PDO
PDO fetch methods - fetch(), fetch all (), fetch column (), fetch object ()
counting rows in PDo and returning them
getting error messages
sanitizing input with quote()
and 
i started pdo prepared statement- binding inputs and output values , bindparam(),bindvalue();

As the tutorials were taken, i implemented the training myself to avoid abstract learning and easy understanding.


For the side project, at the end of the day

I duplicated my contact form for the and i added pdo to the replica of the form
and then i created database source name
I coonected to the database both the PDO and procedural
I've been able to get date time stamp and how to store in the database
I also did my research, and i've been able to store arrays into the database
I was able to fetch the data from the database unto the admin page for the side page
